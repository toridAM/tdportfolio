            <h1 class="case2">case study</h1>
            <p>This was a fictional case study performed for apartment buildings. One key for security entrance and one key for renters unit.</p>
            <p>Two keys are required from renters to give access to their security building entrance and unit.</p>
            <h2 class="case2">Problem</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Non-renters has key to apartment but not to security entrance</li>
                <li>Renter unavailable by being out of the building, hired services need access to security building an renters unit.</li>
                <li>Renter has health issues and is unable to respond to call or text. </li>
                <li>On Weekends management is unavailable to let non-renters into building/unit</li>
            </ol>
            <h2 class="case2">Research</h2>
            <p>The research took place at a apartment complex.</p>
            
            <p>The goal was to ask 100 people.</p>
            <h2 class="case2">Selected question</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Would you rather have 2 keys or use an app to enter the building/unit?</li>
                <li>How do you feel about giving your username and password to people that you will need to enter your apartment building and unit?</li>
                <li>do you feel your privacy is being protected</li>
            </ol>
           
            <h2 class="case2">findings</h2>
            <p>80 out of 100 people were interested in using an app vs using a key system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Building has a call system in place but does not work 80% of the time.</li>
                <li>Renters where not able to recieve message or call with the system in place.</li>
             </ul>
            <h2 class="case2">challenge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Renters where not at home.</li>
                <li>Renters not able to receive call and connect with non-renters.</li>
                <li>Renters where unresponsive due to health issues.</li>
             </ul>
            
            <h2 class="case2">conclustion</h2>
            <p>Non-renters where unable to enter the security building and renters unit even when they where expected because the call system was not connecting 
                non-renter and renter together.</p>
            <p>The key app allows renters to enter their security building and not need keys only their phone.</p>
            <p>The Key app allows non-renters to enter the security building and renters unit when renter has health issues and is non-responsive</p>
            <p>The key app allows non-renters to enter the security building and renters unit when renter is not at home.</p>
            <p>The key app allows non-renters to enter the security building and renters unit on weekends when management is off.</p>
            <h2 class="case2">the outcome</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The key app eliminates the use of keys, but will need app downloaded on your phone.</li>
                <li>The key app makes it easy to enter a security building and renters unit when required.</li>
            </ul>
