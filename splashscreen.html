            <h1 class="case2">case study</h1>
            <p>This was a fictional case study performed for apartment buildings. 2 keys are needed 1 to enter security entrance and 1 to enter renter"s unit.</p>
            
            <h2 class="case2">Problem</h2>
                <p>Renter's stepped out when expecting visitors.</p>
                <p>Renters where unresponsive due to health issues.</p>
                <p>Non-renters had 1 key to apartment but not to security entrance</p>
                <p>Renters had to pay for extra keys to give out for access to building and unit.</p>
                <p>No management available on weekends to let non-renters into building/unit</p>
                
            <h2 class="case2">Research</h2>
                <p>The goal was to ask 100 people.</p>
                <p>The research took place at an apartment complex.</p>

            <h2 class="case2">Selected question</h2>
                <p>Do you feel your privacy is being protected?</p>
                <p>Would you rather have 2 keys or use an app to enter the building/unit?</p>
                <p>Are you comfortable giving username and password for access to building/unit?</p>
                
            
           <h2 class="case2">findings</h2>
                <p>Building has a call system in place but does not work 80% of the time.</p>
                <p>80 out of 100 people were interested in using an app vs using a key system.</p>
                <p>Renters where not able to recieve message or call with the system in place.</p>
             
            <h2 class="case2">challenge</h2>
                <p>Best times to talk to Renters.</p>
                <p>Elderly renters where not comfortable using an app vs keys.</p>
                
             <h2 class="case2">conclustion</h2>
                <p>The key app allows renters to enter their security building and not need keys only their phone.</p>
                <p>The key app allows non-renters to enter the security building and renters unit when renter is not at home.</p>
                <p>The key app allows non-renters to enter the security building and renters unit on weekends when management is off.</p>
                <p>The Key app allows non-renters to enter the security building and renters unit when renter has health issues and is non-responsive</p>
                <p>2 keys are needed 1 to enter security entrance and 1 to enter renter"s unit, which cost money to make 2 keys for every non-renter you wanted to give access to your appartment/unit.</p>
            
            <h2 class="case2">the outcome</h2>
                <p>The app eliminates the use of keys</p> 
                <p>Renter does not need to buy extra keys</p>
                <p>non-renters can access the building with the app downloaded on their phone.</p>
                <p> To enter the apartment building and unit you will need a phone to down load the app.</p>
                <p>The key app makes it easy to enter a security building and renters unit when required.</p>
