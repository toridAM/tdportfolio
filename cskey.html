    <h1 id="intro" class="headerone">introduction</h1>
    <p>this was a fictional case study perfomed for apartment buildings.
    2 keys are needed 1 to enter the security entrance and 1 to enter the renter’s
    unit.</p>
    <h1 id="myrole" class="headerone">my role</h1>
    <p>I designed an app to enter the building and identify the pre existing problems
    when trying to use this building as a visitor.</p>
    <h1 id="problems" class="headerone"> problems</h1>
    <p> some renter’s stepped out of the building or where somewhere elce in the building when 
        visitors where trying to get come in.
    some renter’s where unresponsive due to health issues so when a visitor would come over the renter was unable to respond.
    non-renters had a key to the renter's unit, but not a key to building entrance.
    renters had to pay for extra keys to give out for access to building and unit.
    management is not available on weekends to let non-renters into building/unit.</p>
    <h1 id="goals" class="headerone">goals</h1>
    <p>to allow non renters and renters to enter the building and unit with out a key,
    by using an app to unlock doors.</p>
    <h1 id="impact" class="headerone">impact</h1>
    <p>the impact of this test proved that it was more accessable for the renter and the visitor to enter the building and unit 
        by using an app as apose to using two keys to enter the building.</p>
    <h1 id="earlyideation" class="headerone">early ideation</h1>
    <p>i gathered inspiration of how other where entering the building
    and if they lived their or where coming to visit a unit for work/
    family related experience.</p>
    <h1 id="testing" class="headerone">testing</h1>
    <p>the testing took place in the lobby of the apartment building
    I stayed 1 hour asking 50 people 3 questions.
    do you feel your privacy is being protected?
    whould you rather have 2 keys or use an app to enter the building/unit?
    are you confortable giving username and password for access to building/unit?</p>
    <h1 id="finaldesign" class="headerone">final design</h1>
    <p>the final design was to create an app that users would gravitate to by color choice and purpose.</p>
    <h1 id="development" class="headerone">development</h1>
    <p>I built the responsive landing page on github using visual studio code.
    I design the prototype in figma.
    and at this time this app is in the infinte stage and needs to be created by a
    front end developer so that it is able to be launched into action.</p>
    <h1 id="futuresteps" class="headerone">future steps</h1>
    <p>the future steps is to create this app and put it on the market for building owners.</p>
