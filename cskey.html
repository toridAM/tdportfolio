    <h1 id="intro" class="headerone">introduction</h1>
    <p>this was a fictional case study perfomed for apartment buildings.
    2 keys are needed 1 to enter the security entrance and 1 to enter the renter’s
    unit.</p>
    <h1 id="myrole" class="headerone">my role</h1>
    <p>I designed an app to enter the building and identify the pre existing problems
    when trying to use this building as a visitor.</p>
    <h1 id="problems" class="headerone"> problems</h1>
        <p> 20% of renter’s stepped out of the building when visitors came over. </p>
        <p>10% of renter's when inside the building but not in their apartment.</p>
        <p>10% of renter’s where unresponsive due to health issues.</p>
        <p>30% of non-renter's had a key to the renter's unit, but not a key to building entrance.</p>
    <p>100% of all renter's had to pay for extra keys to give out for access to building and unit.</p>
    <p>management is not available on weekends to let non-renter's into building/unit.</p>
    <h1 id="goals" class="headerone">goals</h1>
    <p>to allow non renter's and renter's to enter the building and unit without a key,
    by using an app to unlock doors.</p>
    <h1 id="impact" class="headerone">impact</h1>
    <p>the impact of this test proved that it was more accessable for the renter and the visitor's to enter the building and unit 
        by using an app as apose to using two keys to enter the building.</p>
    <h1 id="earlyideation" class="headerone">early ideation</h1>
    <p>i gathered inspiration of how other where entering the building
    and if they lived their or where coming to visit a unit for work/
    family related experience.</p>
    <h1 id="testing" class="headerone">testing</h1>
        <p>the testing took place in the lobby of the apartment building.</p></br>
        <p>duration:&nbsp1 hour</p></br>
            <p>50/100 people where asked 3 questions.</p></br>
        <p>do you feel your privacy is being protected?</p></br>
    <p>whould you rather have 2 keys or use an app to enter the building/unit?</p></br>
    <p>are you confortable giving your username and password for access to building/unit?</p>
    <h1 id="finaldesign" class="headerone">final design</h1>
    <p>the final design was to create an app that users would gravitate to by color choice and purpose.</p>
    <h1 id="development" class="headerone">development</h1>
    <p>landing page is hosted on github design tool - visual studio code.
    prototype designed in figma.
    this is a fictional case study and is in the infinte stage, it needs a
    front end developer in order to be launched into the next action.</p>
    <h1 id="futuresteps" class="headerone">future steps</h1>
    <p>the future steps is to create this app and put it on the market for building owner's/renter's.</p>
