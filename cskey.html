    <h1 id="intro" class="headerone">introduction</h1>
    <p>this was a fictional case study perfomed for apartment buildings.
    2 keys are needed 1 to enter the security entrance and 1 to enter renter’s
    unit.</p>
    <h1 id="myrole" class="headerone">my role</h1>
    <p>I designed an app to enter the building and identify the pre existing problems
    when trying to use this building as a visitor.</p>
    <h1 id="problems" class="headerone"> problems</h1>
    <p>renter’s stepped out when expecting visitors.
    renter’s where unresponsive due to health issues.
    non-renters had 1 key to unit but not a key to building entrance.
    renters had to pay for extra keys to give out for access to building and unit.
    management is not available on weekends to let non-renters into building/unit.</p>
    <h1 id="goals" class="headerone">goals</h1>
    <p>to allow non renters and renters to enter the building and unit with out a key,
    by using an app to unlock doors.</p>
    <h1 id="impact" class="headerone">impact</h1>
    <p>here you want to put how people viewed the use of the app/ testing comments</p>
    <h1 id="earlyideation" class="headerone">early ideation</h1>
    <p>i gathered inspiration of how other where entering the building
    and if they lived their or where coming to visit a unit for work/
    family related experience.</p>
    <h1 id="testing" class="headerone">testing</h1>
    <p>the testing took place in the lobby of the apartment building
    I stayed 1 hour asking 50 people 3 questions.
    do you feel your privacy is being protected?
    whould you rather have 2 keys or use an app to enter the building/unit?
    are you confortable giving username and password for access to building/unit?</p>
    <h1 id="finaldesign" class="headerone">final design</h1>
    <p>was creating an app that users would gravitate to by color choice and purpose.</p>
    <h1 id="development" class="headerone">development</h1>
    <p>I built the responsive landing page on github using visual studio code.
    I design the prototype in figma.
    and at this time this app is in the infinte stage and needs to be created by a
    front end developer so that it is able to be launched into action.</p>
    <h1 id="futuresteps" class="headerone">future steps</h1>
    <p>here is the future plans for this landing page</p>
    <p>to maintain and update the landing page and ensure information are up to date.</p>
